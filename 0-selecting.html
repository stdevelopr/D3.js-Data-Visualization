<!-- Let’s walk through what just happened. In sequence, we:
1- Invoked D3's select method, which selects a single element from the DOM using CSS selector syntax. (We selected the body.)
2- Created a new p element and appended that to the end of our selection, meaning just before the closing body tag in this case.
3- Set the text content of that new, empty paragraph to “New paragraph!”
All of those crazy dots are just part of D3’s chain syntax.
